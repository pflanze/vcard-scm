;; possibly-compile and load

;; BUGS:

;; - sometimes when loading compiled object, editing file, reloading
;; into running system it will compile and load, then on subsequent
;; load give the 'cannot load multiple times' error

;; - sometimes, with (define compile-mode 'c), a file that has been
;; compiled, when edited, will not get reloaded into the running
;; system from source, neither freshly compiled. strange. Only time
;; this happened was with Serialization-Deserialization.scm
